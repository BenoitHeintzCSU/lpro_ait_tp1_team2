# Arduino shield motor assembly procedure 

Purpose: This sheet describes how to test the program  and  the motor.

## 1. Preparation / material needed :

- Arduino 1.8.8 software.
- EMG30 motor x1
- Pololu DRV8835 Dual motor driver shield for Arduino x1
- Arduino Uno x1

## 2. Operating mode :

The purpose of this program is to make the motor rotating 2 secondes in anticlokwise with a
lit led on the Arduino, then to rotate 2 secondes on the normal clockwise, with the OFF Led. 
This led ON/OFF cycle depends of the motor's connection.

To test the program, we will follow the arduino_motordrivers_motor_assembly_procedure and then implement the Arduino program, called **motor_control_open_loop**, contained in the **sources** document, as well as the different libraries obtained from this link **http://www.pololu.com/product/2511**. If we observe the different steps described in the previous paragraph, we can validate the test of the motor.

# Arduino shield motor assembly procedure 


Purpose: This sheet describes how to mount the shield to the arduino and then assembly the motor.


## 1. Preparation / material needed :

- EMG30 motor x1
- Flat screwdriver x1
- Pololu DRV8835 Dual motor driver shield for Arduino x1
- Arduino Uno x1
- Arduino jumper x1


## 2. Operating mode :

First, put the **jumper** on the V_out pins, and the **Pololu DRV8835** on the Arduino. The **Pololu**'s pins are paires as follows : The V_cc and the 5V ; The Ground with the Ground, and the V_in to the AV_in. (see picture).

Second, the motor's alimentation wires are 


## 3. Criterion of acceptability and refusal :
